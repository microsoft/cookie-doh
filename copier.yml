  Your project "{{ project_name }}" has been created successfully! ðŸŽ‰

  Required dependencies:
  * Make sure you have `python >= 3.10` and `poetry` installed.
  * Instructions: https://microsoft.github.io/cookie-doh/dev_setup
  * You can also install optional tools like `direnv` and `pre-commit` following the link above
  if needed for your project.

  Next steps:

  1. Change directory and initialize GitHub:

     $ cd {{ _copier_conf.dst_path }}  # direnv will ask you to type `direnv allow` (if you have direnv installed)
     $ git init

  {% if repo_exists -%}
  2. Pull repository into your newly created project:

     $ git remote add origin https://github.com/{{ organization }}/{{ project_name }}.git
     $ git pull origin main  # and resolve any conflicts

  {% else -%}
  2. Create a new repository on GitHub:

    a. Install the GitHub CLI (if you haven't already): https://cli.github.com/
    b. Authenticate with GitHub and create the new repository:

       $ gh auth login
       $ gh repo create {{ organization }}/{{ project_name }} --private --source=. --remote=origin
       $ cd {{ _copier_conf.dst_path }}

  {% endif -%}

  3. Add project dependencies to `pyproject.toml` and install them with Poetry:

     $ poetry add <new-dependencies>  # optional
     $ poetry install

  4. Add the project outputs, configure pre-commit and commit your changes:

     $ git add .
     {% if precommit -%}
     $ pre-commit install --install-hooks
     {% endif -%}
     $ git commit -m "init: initialize repo"

  5. Happy coding! ðŸš€
