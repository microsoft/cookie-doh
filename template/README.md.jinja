## :rocket: Getting started with {{ project_name }}

<Write your getting started section.>


## :space_invader: Codespaces

We provide a configured devcontainer for you to use in your new project and/or cookie-doh itself.
You can create a container image with all the necessary dependencies,
and use it for remote development in a remote node with [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)
or [DevPod](https://devpod.sh/).

:point_right: Click below to clone or fork this repository automatically and start developing:

[![Open in DevPod!](https://devpod.sh/assets/open-in-devpod.svg)](https://devpod.sh/open#https://github.com/{{organization}}/{{project_name}})


## :gear: Devcontainer

Alternatively, you can build a local container directly and use it in VSCode and/or
PyCharm without developing in a remote node or setting up a local environment.

Learn about [Devcontainers](https://containers.dev/).
Requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed on your local machine.

:point_right: Follow instructions for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)
and/or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/connect-to-devcontainer.html).


## :computer: Local development

The only required dependency is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
However, we recommend installing some extra dependencies to improve the development experience.

:point_right: Follow [instructions](https://microsoft.github.io/cookie-doh/dev_setup)
to set up your local environment.


## :hammer_and_wrench: Description of development tools:

{{ project_name}} uses the following tools to facilitate the development experience:

* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python management, dependency management, virtual environments and
packaging, i.e., makes your code readily importable!
* [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for formatting and linting: helps you write clean and uniform code for better consistency (and it's fast!).
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing: ensures your code is working as expected!
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for static annotations: helps identify simple errors, but more importantly,
makes your code more readable!
* [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) for spell checking: pinpoints spelling errors across code and documents.
* [CI workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration): automates validation when you submit a PR or merge to `main` branch.
{% if documentation -%}
* [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for beautiful markdown documentation builds (like [cookie-doh](https:microsoft.github.io/cookie-doh)'s).
{% endif -%}
{% if precommit -%}
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for quick validation checks and fixes before committing.
{% endif -%}
{% if commitizen -%}
* [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/)
for writing [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), to help write better commit messages
and track changes through [time](https://github.com/microsoft/cookie-doh/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
